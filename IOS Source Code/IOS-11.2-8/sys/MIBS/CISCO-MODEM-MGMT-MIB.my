                    receiver to dial or answer a call.

                    connected: The modem is in a state when it can transmit or
                    receive data over the communications line.

                    calls.

                    disabled: The modem is in a reset state and non-functional.
                    This state can be set and clear via cmHoldReset.

                    bad: The modem is suspected or proven to be bad.  The
                    operator can take the modem out of service and mark
                    the modem as 'bad' via cmBad.

                    loopback: The modem is in a state where it is currently
                    running back-to-back loopback testing.

                    downloadFirmware: The modem is in a state where it is 
                    currently downloading the firmware.

                    noDialTone: the dial out attempt has failed because the
                    modem failed to detect a dial tone.

                    busy: the call attempt failed because the modem detected
                    a busy signal.
