FUNCTION
        strtol---string to long

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
        #include <stdlib.h>
        long strtol(const char *s, char **ptr,int base);

        long _strtol_r(void *reent,
                       const char *s, char **ptr,int base);

DESCRIPTION
        The function strtol converts the string *s to a long. First,
        it breaks down the string into three parts: leading
        whitespace, which is ignored; a subject string consisting of
        characters resembling an integer in the radix specified by
        base; and a trailing portion consisting of zero or more
        unparseable characters, and always including the terminating
        null character. Then, it attempts to convert the subject
        string into a long and returns the result.

        If the value of base is 0, the subject string is expected to
        look like a normal C integer constant: an optional sign, a
        possible `0x' indicating a hexadecimal base, and a number. If
        base is between 2 and 36, the expected form of the subject is
        a sequence of letters and digits representing an integer in
        the radix specified by base, with an optional plus or minus
        sign. The letters a--z (or, equivalently, A--Z) are used to
        signify values from 10 to 35; only letters whose ascribed
        values are less than base are permitted. If base is 16, a
        leading 0x is permitted.

        The subject sequence is the longest initial sequence of the
        input string that has the expected form, starting with the
        first non-whitespace character.  If the string is empty or
        consists entirely of whitespace, or if the first
        non-whitespace character is not a permissible letter or digit,
        the subject string is empty.

        If the subject string is acceptable, and the value of base is
        zero, strtol attempts to determine the radix from the input
        string. A string with a leading 0x is treated as a hexadecimal
        value; a string with a leading 0 and no x is treated as octal;
        all other strings are treated as decimal. If base is between 2
        and 36, it is used as the conversion radix, as described
        above. If the subject string begins with a minus sign, the
        value is negated. Finally, a pointer to the first character
        past the converted subject string is stored in ptr, if ptr is
        not NULL.

        If the subject string is empty (or not in acceptable form), no
        conversion is performed and the value of s is stored in ptr
        (if ptr is not NULL).

        The alternate function _strtol_r is a reentrant version.  The
        extra argument reent is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

RETURNS
        strtol returns the converted value, if any. If no conversion
        was made, 0 is returned.

        strtol returns LONG_MAX or LONG_MIN if the magnitude of the
        converted value is too large, and sets errno to ERANGE.

PORTABILITY
        strtol is ANSI.

        No supporting OS subroutines are required.
